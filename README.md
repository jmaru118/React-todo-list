# React Todo App

This is a react todo app created from scratch that is meant to simulate a full stack
experience. The program grabs api data from the public/data.json object which contains
a task list. These are parsed out by group and a grouped task list is then created. 
Tasks can be marked as complete and locked tasks can only be toggle once their
dependent tasks have been completed.
